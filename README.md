# particle_filter
* To run the code just run the particle_filter.py file.
* Initially, the sensor model will build it's cache which takes 3-5 minutes.
* There are a lot of dependencies you might have to install, I haven't had the chance to create a requirements file.
* Notably, you'll need cPickle and pathos.multiprocessing.
